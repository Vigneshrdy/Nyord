## 🔄 **Real-Life Example: How Automatic EMI Works**

Let's say **Rahul** took a ₹1,00,000 loan with ₹5,000 monthly EMI:

1. **Every night at 12 AM**, the system checks all loans
2. Finds Rahul's EMI is due today
3. Checks his account - he has ₹15,000
4. ✅ Deducts ₹5,000 automatically
5. Sends notification: "EMI paid successfully"
6. His loan balance reduces to ₹95,000
7. Next EMI date set to next month

**What if Rahul only had ₹2,000?**
- ❌ System won't deduct (no penalty!)
- Sends alert: "Low balance - EMI payment failed"
- Rahul can add money and pay manually
