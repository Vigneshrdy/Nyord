{"question":"How do I register a new user?","answer":"POST /auth/register with {username, email, password}. The response contains an access_token and user object. Use that token for Authorization header on future requests.","source":"docs/project_corpus.txt"}
{"question":"Which endpoint creates transactions?","answer":"POST /transactions/initiate — send {src_account, dest_account, amount, idempotency_key}. Successful response includes transaction_id and status.","source":"docs/project_corpus.txt"}
{"question":"Why use RabbitMQ in this architecture?","answer":"RabbitMQ decouples heavy background work from the API gateway so the user-facing API remains fast and reliable; it supports durable queues, retries, DLQs, and flexible routing (fanout/topic/direct).","source":"docs/project_corpus.txt"}
{"question":"What should I do if a transfer fails with insufficient funds?","answer":"The worker publishes a transfer.failed.insufficient_funds event. Check the API error payload, verify account balances and statuses, and inspect Celery worker logs for detailed failure reasons. Also confirm idempotency handling so retries don't duplicate operations.","source":"docs/project_corpus.txt"}
{"question":"How do WebSocket notifications reach the frontend?","answer":"Backend publishes notify.user.<id> events to RabbitMQ; a rabbitmq->ws listener forwards them to connected WebSocket clients. The frontend opens ws://.../ws?token=<jwt> and receives notifications in real time.","source":"docs/project_corpus.txt"}
{"question":"How do I run the backend and frontend in development?","answer":"Backend: activate virtualenv and run `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`. Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`. Ensure env vars (DATABASE_URL, RABBITMQ_URL, JWT_SECRET) are set.","source":"docs/project_corpus.txt"}
{"question":"How to debug if Celery tasks are not executing?","answer":"Confirm Celery workers are running and connected to the same broker (RABBITMQ_URL). Use `celery -A app.celery_app status` and `celery -A app.celery_app inspect active` to inspect workers and active tasks. Check worker logs for exceptions.","source":"docs/project_corpus.txt"}
{"question":"What is an idempotency key and why is it used?","answer":"An idempotency key prevents duplicate processing when a client retries a request. Use unique keys for externally visible operations (like transfers) so retries return the same result without side effects.","source":"docs/project_corpus.txt"}
{"question":"Where are admin analytics and dashboards sourced from?","answer":"Admin dashboards use data indexed into Elasticsearch (transaction trends, logs, fraud alerts) rather than hitting Postgres for heavy queries.","source":"docs/project_corpus.txt"}
{"question":"Who is the project mentor?","answer":"Project Mentor: Anusha Mahanthi.","source":"docs/project_corpus.txt"}
